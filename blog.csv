1,Welcome to my website!,"Hello and Happy Holidays! It's currently 3 days until Christmas, and this year has been incredibly busy around the holidays. As the year ends, I like to reflect and appreciate how the year has gone. I have to say, 2023 was an amazing year. For my career, I obtained my Data Science Certificate and am already seeking more certificates, side projects, and advice on what to do next to continue improving. Outside of my career, this has been one of the most enjoyable years I've had with my friends and family. Between all the events and time spent with everyone, I feel incredibly fortunate for everyone and everything this year. And if I had the opportunity to connect with you this year, I greatly appreciate it. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday and a great 2024!",12/22/2023
